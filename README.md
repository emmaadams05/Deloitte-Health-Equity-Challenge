# 🌍 Aware Air  
*Promoting health equity one breath at a time*  

This project was created for **Deloitte’s and Kode with Klossy’s AI Health Equity Challenge**, where we explored how artificial intelligence and technology can help address pressing **health equity issues**.  

Our focus was on **air quality inequities** in the United States—particularly how **low-income communities and people of color** are disproportionately exposed to harmful air pollution. This project demonstrates how interactive technology and AI-driven tools can empower individuals and communities to better understand, respond to, and advocate for clean air.

## 🚀 Features  

### 🔎 Air Quality Awareness
- Visualizes the impact of **socioeconomic and racial inequities** on air quality and health outcomes.
- Provides resources for users to find **free masks and health centers** near them.  

### 🗺️ Stay Safe: Location-Based AQI
- Users can check the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for their current location.
- Integrates an interactive **map and iframe tool** to show real-time AQI data.  
- Offers **safety recommendations** tailored for different at-risk populations (children, elderly, pregnant persons, immunocompromised individuals).

### 🎨 Interactive Tabs for AQI Levels
- A **tab system** color-coded by AQI level (green, yellow, orange, red, purple).  
- Each tab displays **population-specific safety tips** depending on air quality severity.  

### 🖥️ Frontend Design
- Built with **React.js**.  
- Includes modular components for:
  - `Navbar`
  - `Clouds`
  - `StaySafe` (AQI + map)  
  - `HealthEquity` (educational + resource hub)  
  - `Tabs` (safety guidelines by AQI level)
